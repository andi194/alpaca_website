         <h2>Types of alpacas</h2>
         <br>
  <h3>Huacaya</h3> 
   <img src="https://images.freeimages.com/images/large-previews/865/sca-alpacas-2-1233602.jpg" alt="alpaca face"
  width="400" height="300">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
    <p> The huacaya appearance is due to its fibre growing vertically out of its skin in small bundles with a tight crimped wave which makes 
    the fleece sit vertically off the skin giving it a 'Teddy Bear' look. The huacaya fibre is more akin to a woollen process of manufacture.</p>
  </div>
</div>
      <h3>Suri</h3> 
      <img src="https://images.freeimages.com/images/large-previews/057/bad-hair-day-alpaca-1337393.jpg" alt ="messy hair alpaca"
    width="400" height="300">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
		  <p>The suri appearance is due to its fibre growing out of the skin in bundles/locks without any crimped wave. This makes the suri 
			locks twist and hang down along the flank of the alpaca giving it an appearance much like a Wensleydale sheep. The suri fibre at its
       best is akin to silk and lends itself to the worsted process of manufacture. It is seeing increasing use in men's suiting and coats.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>What do alpacas eat?</h3> 
<br>
          <p>Alpacas mainly eat grass or hay, and not much—approximately two pounds per 125 pounds of body weight per day. The general rule of thumb is 1.5% of the animal’s body weight daily in hay or fresh pasture. A single, 60 pound bale of hay can generally feed a group of about 20 alpacas for one day. Grass hay is recommended, while alfalfa should be fed sparingly, due to its overly rich protein content. Alpacas are pseudo-ruminants, with a single stomach divided into three compartments. They produce rumen and chew cud, thus they are able to process this modest amount of food very efficiently. Many alpacas (especially pregnant and lactating females) will benefit from nutritional and mineral supplements, depending on local conditions. There are several manufactured alpaca and llama feeds and mineral mixes readily available; consult with your local veterinarian to ensure you are feeding the appropriate diet for your area. Alpacas also require access to plenty of fresh water to drink.
          Alpacas have two sets of teeth for processing food. They have molars in the back of the jaw for chewing cud. But in the front,
         the alpaca has teeth only on the bottom and a hard gum (known as a dental pad) on the top for crushing grain, grass, or hay.</p>
<br>
         <p> Unlike goats and sheep that have long tongues which they sometimes use to rip plants out of the ground, alpacas have short 
          tongues and nibble only the tops of grasses and other plants, resulting in less disturbance of the vegetation. However, 
          alpacas are also browsers and will often eat shrubs or the leaves from trees if given the opportunity. This requires monitoring to ensure they do not consume harmful products. </p>

        <h3>Are alpacas easy to care for?</h3> 
            <br>
         <p>They are a small and relatively easy livestock to maintain. They stand about 36' high at the withers (where the neck and spine
           come together); weigh between 100 to 200 pounds; and establish easy-to-manage, communal dung piles. The alpacas need basic shelter
            and protection from heat and foul weather, just like other types of livestock, and they also require certain vaccinations and
             anti-parasitic medicines. Their fleece is sheared once a year to keep them cool in summer. 
             <br>
             <p>Additionally, their toenails need to be trimmed on an as-needed basis to ensure proper foot alignment and comfort. Interestingly, alpacas do not have hooves — 
             instead, they have two toes, with hard toenails on top and a soft pad on the bottom of their feet, which minimizes their effect
              on pastures and makes them an "environmentally friendly" animal.</p>
