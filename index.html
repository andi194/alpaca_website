  <h2> What are alpacas?</h2>

  <h2>Types of alpacas</h2>
  <h3>Huacaya</h3>

    <p>The huacaya appearance is due to its fibre growing vertically out of its skin in small bundles with a tight crimped wave which makes 
	  the fleece sit vertically off the skin giving it a 'Teddy Bear' look. The huacaya fibre is more akin to a woollen process of manufacture.</p>
      <h3>Suri</h3>

		  <p>The suri appearance is due to its fibre growing out of the skin in bundles/locks without any crimped wave. This makes the suri 
			locks twist and hang down along the flank of the alpaca giving it an appearance much like a Wensleydale sheep. The suri fibre at its
			 best is akin to silk and lends itself to the worsted process of manufacture. It is seeing increasing use in men's suiting and coats.</p>
